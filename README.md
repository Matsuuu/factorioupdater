# Factorio updater

### This tool works as a automatic updater for a factorio-server running on linux.

Files of this repository should be located in the same directory as the "factorio" directory eg. /opt/

To automatically check for updates, add ``updatefactorio.sh`` to your cronjobs

Current setup works only with factorio 0.16.x
